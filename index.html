        <h2>About Starfire</h2>
        <p>Starfire is a cooperative card game inspired by the
        fast-paced starfighter combat in sci-fi movies and TV shows.
        Players work together to destroy the enemy base before their
        squad or home base is wiped out.</p>
        <p>With Starfire's unique "fray" system, enemy fighters pursue a
        specific player or the home base. Players cannot attack their own
        pursuers, and cannot attack the enemy base unless they are free of
        pursuers. This ensures that players must work together and choose their
        actions wisely to succeed.</p>
        <p>Teamwork is essential to victory, but one pilot may shine above the
        rest. Prove your skills to your commanding officers and you may get
        promoted... if you survive.</p>
