        h2 About #{gameTitle}
        p #{gameTitle} (working title) is a cooperative card game for 2-4 players inspired by the 
          | fast-paced starfighter combat in sci-fi movies and TV shows.
          | Players work together to destroy the enemy base before their
          | squad or home base is wiped out.
        p With #{gameTitle}'s unique 'fray' system, enemy fighters pursue a 
          | specific player or the home base. Players cannot attack their own
          | pursuers, and cannot attack the enemy base unless they are free of
          | pursuers. This ensures that players must work together and choose their
          | actions wisely to succeed.
        //- p Teamwork is essential to victory, but one pilot may shine above the 
        //-   | rest. Prove your skills to your commanding officers and you may get
        //-   | promoted... if you survive.
